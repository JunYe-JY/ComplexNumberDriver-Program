# ComplexNumberDriver-Program

A program that is programmed in C++ that calculates complex numbers using OOP.

Created a class structure called ComplexNumber to contain a default constructor, value constructor, mutator and accessor functions.
Used overloaded binary operators(+, -, *, /) as member functions, '<<' as a friend function, and overloaded unary operator(!). 

Used vectors to store and print out complex numbers.
